# SQLTUTORIAL


## Functional Requirements:

Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This is called a short link. This link should be short enough to be easily copied and pasted into applications.
- When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.
- Users should optionally be able to pick a custom short link for their URL.
- Links will expire after a standard default timespan. Users should be able to specify the expiration time.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

- The system should be highly available. This is required because, if our service is down, all the URL redirections will start failing.
- URL redirection should happen in real-time with minimal latency.
- Shortened links should not be guessable (not predictable).

## Extended Requirements:

- Analytics; e.g., how many times a redirection happened?
- Our service should also be accessible through REST APIs by other services.
